The netcat portable patched version was created by Jay Fink 
<jay.fink@gmail.com> using Ubuntu and Debian patches.
The netcat-openbsd Debian package was created by Soren Hansen
<soren@ubuntu.com> and by Decklin Foster <decklin@red-bean.com>, based
loosely on the original netcat package. The code itself was rewritten
by the OpenBSD project, from the original implementation by Hobbit
<hobbit@atstake.com>.
